      <p>
        Our selection of posters and prints includes entertainment and specialty
        posters, decorative prints, and art reproductions. Whether you are
        looking for a vintage exclusive, a print from war time ad campaigns, or
        a poster that reflects a specific era, you will find it at Schroeder's
        Art. Schroeder's Art value-added services, including framing and
        mounting, provide customers with the option to enhance the appearance of
        their poster or art print. Our framing service allows customers to
        choose from a variety of high-quality frames, mats, and glass. Our
        unique mounting service permanently bonds prints to a durable hardboard
        backing. Both services produce high-quality, attractive finished
        products at a reasonable price.
